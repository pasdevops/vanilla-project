About the project
This is my final piece of homework from The Jump's vanilla javascript module on their full stack developer bootcamp course.

I was tasked to create a simple weather application that gets data from an api and manipulates the DOM using vanilla javascript to display the data on the screen.

Project features
The app uses geolocation to get a users current location and displays the weather for where they are. There is an input box where a user can search for a place; this then returns the weather for the location searched.

The app gives the user the current weather, the days forecast in hourly intervals and also a daily forecast for the following 5 days.

The features of this apps involves when the user input thier location and they will receive the weather forcast in real-time.
